		<h1>Welcome to SearchManipulator Gold Set 2</h1>

		Welcome to SearchManipulator Set 2. The point of this set is to promote websites from Set 1 and websites you are already on that are high ranking. You want to focus on promoting the neutral or postive websites that are directly below your negative website on the Google search results for your name. If a page did not load, try reloading it (Ctrl+R). If a page has been updated, please let us know, and complete the website to the best of your ability.</p>

		<p>Click on the smaller fox icon above the big fox in the top right of your screen. This screen will memorize your data. Create a new Yahoo.com email address, because it will be spammed. Make sure to have at least 5 biographies added. Professionally written SEO biographies can be purchased from <a href="http://www.SearchManipulator.com/Buy-Now">SearchManipulator</a>, or you can provide your own. Click on the "?" for help on each field. </p>

		<p>The URL Guide is a list of websites that will be created in this set. It is a good practice to view each one at the end. </p>

		<p>Make sure you are not logged into Twitter, LinkedIn, Wordpress or any social media website used in this program. If so, push Ctrl+Shift+Del. Facebook is not utilized, so it's okay.</p>

		<p>Type in all of your data to each field, with the possible exception of Bio 2-10 and Link/Link Title, and click "GO". Work from left to right on the tabs. Look for instructions whenever you see the fox logo.</p>
